= End-to-end

## Introduction
This file is an [end-to-end test](#) to see if koara works in *all* possible configuration scenario's. For example:
- allow `paragraphs`
- allow `paragraphs + headers
- allow lists + images
- ...

There are many scenario's where you want to have different scenario's
1. Blog post
2. Comment
3. Chatmessage
4. ...

Because of the _modular_ nature of koara, we want to make sure that all fallback scencario's work 
as expected. This becomes even more important when the language evolves in the future. 
> The goal of koara is to make it work in any use case where a developer wants to enhance the writing experience of the 
user. 

## Configuration
You can set modules like this:
```
Parser parser = new Parser();
parser.setIncludes("paragraphs", "headers");
Document document = parser.parse(kd);
```
